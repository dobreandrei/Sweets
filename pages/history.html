 <h2>A brief History of Sweets</h2>
 
<p>The earliest sweet which people have eaten since prehistoric times was honey. The origins of confectionery can be traced back to about 2000BC to the ancient Egyptians who made sweets by combining fruits and nuts with honey. The Romans, Greeks and Chinese made sweets with sesame seeds.</p>



 <p>This stayed the norm through to the Middle Ages where people ate preserved fruits, wafers and jellies. Sweet foods became more popular during the age of the Tudors, however it was still restricted to the aristocracy and the more affluent in society due to the price of sugar being very expensive.
 In the Middle Ages doctors have learn how to mask bad taste of medicines. They have been mixed them with sugar and from the beginning of the twentieth century many ozenges, gums and pastiles that served as throat soothers, stomach warmers or healthy energy givers were made. </p>

<p>The Tudors ate similar sweets to those during the Middle Ages, a lot of jellies, sugared almonds and preserved fruits; the Tudors called these sweetmeats. It is well documented that Henry VIII had a very 'sweet tooth' and used to have huge banquets of sweetmeats alongside his regular foods. The main difference between the Tudors and the Middle Ages was the introduction of Marzipan as a sweet. Marzipan was actually invented during the Middle Ages, however the Tudors are the society which were the first to use it as a sweet. Huge statues of animals, castles and a host of other sculptures were created out of marzipan and consumed at events.</p>


<p>Sweets and confectionery did not advance much during the 17th and 18th century as the cost of sugar was so expensive that only the very rich could afford to eat it, therefore demand was not huge. There were however some advancements worthy of note such as Pontefract cakes becoming recognised as a sweet rather than a medicine, the French were making hand made Nougat and the rich across Europe started to eat ice cream.</p>

<p>Sweets as we know them now were not invented until the 19th century, this was mostly due to the industrial revolution. Manufacturing products on a mass scale enabled goods to be made at a fraction of the price they were previously made at. This then brought home the idea that expensive goods once considered exclusive to the upper classes could be made available to middle and lower class families. As the demand for sweets grew and more sweet types were invented, farmers started to grow more sugar cane therefore reducing the global cost of sugar and thus removing the major inhibitory factor keeping sweets from the masses.</p>



<p>As sweets became available to the masses there was a boom in the invention of sweets; a lot of the popular sweets we eat today were invented over 100 hundred years ago, many of which still follow the same original recipe. By the 1850s, there were hundreds of confectionery factories in the United States. </p>

<p>The very first sweets included boiled sweets, marshmallows, and one of the very earliest was Turkish delight. The first candy bar was introduced in Britain by Joseph Fry in 1847. In 1900 Milton S. Hershey invented Hershey's Milk Chocolate. In the 20th century many new kinds of sweets were introduced, such as Tablerone (1908), Milky Way ( 1923), Snickers (1930), Mars bar (1932), Bounty (1951), Twix (1967)... </p>
